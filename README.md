# CSC120_Theory
Assignment for CSC120 with Professor Anderson at Mesa Community College that explores different number bases and numerical operations within and between them.

Users will need a C compiler (cygwin for windows, xcode for mac, gcc, clang, etc for Linux or BSD) and an implementation of the C standard libraries. This program was built on a Linux machine using gcc and the glibc libraries.

## Compiling
Assuming gcc is the compiler, users can run `gcc -o theory theory.c -lm` which will output an executable called theory. 

## Usage
Users can start the program by running ./theory in the program directory, or include the executable in their $PATH and run theory. 

Once the program is started, a menu displays all options.
